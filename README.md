<h3>5 programs to get started with python.</h3>
Things you'll need :<br>
<ol>

<li>Download XAMPP</li>
<li>Include Python in Path of system file</li>
</ol>
<strong>Also for the CGI files the first line of code needs to be:</strong>
<ol>
<li>UNIX:#!/usr/bin/python</li>
<li>Windows:#!C:/Python/python.exe</li>
the path is same as that you included in system PATH
</ol>
I've used mysql as the database that is included in XAMPP
